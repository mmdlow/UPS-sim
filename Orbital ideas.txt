# ORBITAL IDEAS #
#################

1. Better NUS maps
	- Google maps api
	- Include nus shuttle routes
	- Nearby places (food, atms, etc)

	- Schedule
		- Take about a weekC
	- To do:
		- How to retrieve data like shuttle routes
		- Fetch bus timings (look for correct api or something)
		- Mongo/Angular/Django etc
		- Learn the apis first, tutorials etc

2. Game
	a. Lim Kopi Please
		- Vet people's fb posts as an AGC worker

	b. Reigns ripoff 1 (WW2 style game)
		- At the start: get a randomly selected country
		- Cards: yes/no decisions / multiple decisions
		- 2 sides: allies/axis
		- Endgame: lose/win war

	c. Reigns ripoff 2 (Post-apocalyptic survival)
		- At the start: get randomly rolled stats, random starter item(s)
		- Scenarios: 3-4 choices per decisions
			- Kill/spare
			- Accept/don't accept items/companions (guaranteed to get at least 1 new companion/item)
			- Fight encounters with bandits/mutants/monsters (win/lose based ons stats/items acquired)
		- Endgame: lose/die, begin again as one of your current companions

	d. Reigns ripoff 3 (HOA simulator)
		- At the start: basic HDB flat/house
		- Scenarios: yes/no decisions / multiple decisions
			- Stats: Property value, Reputation
			- Beautify the front of your home as much as possible (increases Property value)
			- HOA will demand that you follow their rules (take down decorations, etc)
				- Following their rules will increase Reputation
				- Not following will decrease Reputation
			- Reputation lower: HOA more likely to send hitmen to sabotage your decor
				- Counter by setting up security systems (turrets, alarms etc)
				- This decreases property value slightly
		- Endgame:
			- Property value reaches max: sell house, start new run with new unlocked scenarios
			- Property value reaches zero: default on house, get kicked out, start new run without unlocked scenarios (start over)

	e. Reverse Papers Please
		- You are a smuggler smuggling goods across the causeway
		- Start small items (cigs, bubblegum) and progress to larger items (people smuggling)
		- Can level up smuggling skill trees (Stealth, Luck, Hiding places etc)
		- Gameplay (2D topdown, encounters - enter new screen Pokemon style where you try to get past the checkpoint)
			- Encounters: "Sir you have been stopped for a random check"
			- Everything else: navigate around the airport/checkpoint

	f. Procedurally-generated roguelike dungeon crawler

	g. Extreme UPS simulator
		- 2D top down
		- Speed of delivery vs quality of delivery
			- Chuck packages out of truck at high speed: faster but poor quality delivery
			- Slow down to deliver properly: slower but high quality delivery
			- Monthly pay balanced between quality and speed
		- Special levels: deliver a series of wedding cakes
		- Always in truck/ character can get in and out of truck
		- Randomly generated levels
